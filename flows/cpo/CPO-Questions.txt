Questions for CPO:
----------------------------
General:
- Is there a CPO-Backend to test against ? Mock-Service?
- Should we supply a cpo-node mock service ?

Authorization Request: 
- Is it possible to send the sessionData to the CPO-Node ?
- Can you also provide the token.uid in the authorization request ?
- How does the successful authorization endpoint look like ?
- Does the CPO-Backend also needs informed about an unsuccessful authorization ?



Requirements for CPO-Backend:
----------------------------

Assumed endpoints on CPO-Backend side:

- e.g.: /authorization-successful -> Successful authorization endpoint -> What data do you need here ?  Only sessionId ? Do you also need to get informed in error case ?

Endpoints on CPO-Node side:
- /authorize-session -> payload: session data + token.uid
- /authorization-callback -> receives the VP from SSI-Wallet (not relevant for CPO-Backend)
- /charging-start -> payload: session data
- /charging-update -> payload: session data
- /charging-end -> payload: session data + cdr



Questions for SSI-Wallet / EV-Dashboard:
----------------------------


- Is the token.uid *all* the EV-Dashboard needs to request the VP from the *correct* user ?
- Can we rely on the EV-Dashboard that the VP is sent to the correct SSI-Wallet ?
- Do we get a sessionId + customerDID in the VP coming from the SSI-Wallet ?

- is the exchangeId = sessionId  --> yes we can use the sessionId

- Redirect alles automatisch ? Kein UI ?

- SSI-Wallet, checks that the VP matches the presentation defination + checks signatures/proofs
- Rest checks the CPO-Node

Meeting John 8.3.22:

- What is a transactionId? transactionId is a uuid, it's NOT the exchangeId (in onetime case like ours) multiple transactions maybe necessary
- What should happen if VP never comes from the SSI-Wallet ? --> Timeout on LamA side confirmed on 11.03 
- How does end-confirmation work?

	- stop-session-authorize on cpo node side
	- end-confirmation on cpo-backend side

- What does the SSI-Wallet sign, does it sign the session data from the cop-backend ?
	- not currently, trust url is enough
- Example for Invitation (is coming from john)





George comments 03.03.2022:
My attempt at potential answers:
- Can you also provide the token.uid in the authorization request ? 
I believe this comes from IToken (the OCPI token) in 4?
https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ocn-bridge/blob/develop/src/models/ocpi/tokens.ts

- Do we get a sessionId + customerDID in the VP coming from the SSI-Wallet ?
You've probably seen this already but I think this is what Jon has in mind, no mention of sessionID.

Comments on the flow diagram:

Arrow 3: Add "Request START_SESSION [OCPI - blocking]" so they have a point of reference
Missing arrow between 7 and 9: "return OCPI = COMMAND_RESPONSE = ACCEPTED". This is on CPO backend but might help them understand the flow. From what I've seen Harry wants these flows to be "complete" with no hidden arrows, so I suggest to try to have a version that has the full flow with all arrows.
14: contract ID: Does it come from the VP ("contractID is assumed to be the VC id, though this might be a stretch" https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/REB/pages/3045064731/VC+VP+Formats), or in IToken ("contract_id" property)? 
13: ContractDID - does it exist yet? Looks created in 15.
14: Verification happens in CPO Node calling SSI Wallet?
7-17: Where will the response from /authorization-started be? There's no "Ok" arrow yet. 

End Charging:
Could be expanded on a bit in the future, namely:
- Sending invoice to customer for billing
- Sending invoice to supplier for records
- Customer signs invoice to accept, or leaves it
